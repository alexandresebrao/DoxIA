# DoxIA installer kickstart (build.sh fills in @COMMIT@ and embeds it in the ISO).
#
# The DoxIA wizard (wizard/doxia-installer.py) runs from %pre and asks for the
# language, keyboard, disk, account and computer name; it writes them to
# /tmp/doxia/answers.ks, included below. Anaconda then installs without its own
# interface (cmdline) while the wizard shows the progress. The %post clones the
# latest of this repository's fedora branch, runs the same scripts as a manual
# install and upgrades every package.

cmdline
# Without it, cmdline mode ends at "Press ENTER to quit" on tty1 and never reboots.
# The last %post holds Anaconda until the wizard's Restart button is clicked.
reboot --eject
